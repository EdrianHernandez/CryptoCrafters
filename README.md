[1] <b>Network Scanning employs ARP Protocol, it starts scanning from the address range of 0-255 and is set to scan for 60 seconds. Therefore, some devices in the with greater range might be not scanned. It is recommended to set the addresses of the devices starting from 0.  </b>

[2] <b>Moreover, It is recommendeed to select a LAN adaptor for the system for reduced latency and Network Scanning capabilities. </b>

[3] <b>Vendor might display "Unknown" depending on the availability of the device data on the macvendors API database.   </b>
